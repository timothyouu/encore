## What's in here

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `src/main.ts` | Boots the bridge, routes normalized input to the current screen. |
| `src/glasses.ts` | Serialized, time-limited bridge calls; startup page vs. rebuild. |
| `src/input.ts` | Maps SDK events to `tap` / `doubleTap` / `swipeUp` / `swipeDown` / `listSelect`; drops duplicate events. |
| `src/layout.ts` | Shared geometry from the Paper mockups; right-aligned text via `@evenrealities/pretext`. |
| `src/passages.ts` | The six approved seed passages (spec §7). |
| `src/staff.ts` | Draws a passage on a treble staff and splits it into two 288×112 PNG tiles. |
| `public/fonts/` | One-glyph Noto Music subset for the treble clef (SIL OFL, see `OFL.txt`). |
| `src/screens/` | One file per glasses state (spec §4). |

## Screens

| Mockup | State | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 01 | Selection | Native list, tap to open, double tap to exit |
| 02 | Ready | Staff (2 image tiles), focus line, `tap ● record` (recording not wired yet), double tap back |
